                I had nobody with me, with the big change in life, I was extrmely anxious.
            So I got Yolk, my very first dog. He is such a sweet boy, I love the moment I got
            off work or school, and knowing that he is waiting for me. After that, I got
            protein, because I lost someone important to me. I was first afraid that cat would not
        get along with dog, but turns out, they get along fine(although they are more like roommates).Then, I got
    Shell. How can an egg be complete without the shell? I think I will stop having more cats.Two cats is a 
    party three cats is a cat lady.</p></div>
