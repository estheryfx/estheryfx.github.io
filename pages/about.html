                    <p>
                        I'm a current graduate student studying Computer Science at Northeastern University - Seattle.
                        I recieved my bachelor degree from Department of Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles in 2020.
                        With my background in Statistics, I enjoy thinking through problems from both bussiness and technical
                        perspectives.
