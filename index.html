                “When nothing seems to help, I go and look
                at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock
                perhaps a hundred times without as much as
                a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and
                first blow it will split in two, and I know it
                was not that last blow that did it -- but all that
                had gone before.”<br>
